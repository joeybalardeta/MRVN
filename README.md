<h2> Apex Legends statistics bot </h2>
<br>
<p> I wanted to make a bot that could give me and my friends detailed stats of our Apex Legends gameplay inside of Discord. I wanted to do it myself too so I could learn JavaScript. </p>
<br>
<p> As this is my first time programming in JavaScript, my code may not be the prettiest (sorry to any JS veterans that look at my code and cringe). </p>
